                    Fiber-optic internet, commonly called fiber internet or simply “fiber,” is a broadband connection that can reach speeds of up to 10 
                    Gigabits per second (Gbps) in some areas. The technology uses fiber-optic cable, which amazingly can send data as fast as about 70%

                    is the fastest type of internet connection.

                    Fiber optic internet works by splitting files like movies and games into data packets of zeroes and ones. 
                            A laser flashes this Morse code-type signal into one end of a plastic or glass filament. 
                            The “wire” is about as thick as one strand of human hair.
                            A special sheath called a cladding keeps the beam of light inside the filament. 
                            It bounces off the walls for as far as 60 miles and pops out the other end where a modem 
                            decodes the light into a form your computer can use.
                            Why is fiber optic cable internet so much better than plain ol’ cable internet? Because there’s no copper wire to gum up the works. 
                            Cable internet sends its signals down metal wires. The metal heats up, weakening the signal and picking up interference. 
                            That’s why cable and DSL internet are so much slower and clumsier than fiber optics. Fiber to the home (FTTH) is the use of fiber 
                            optic cable to directly connect to customer homes or premises. FTTH provides an end-to-end fiber optic connection, meaning the transmission 
                            of voice, video, and data traffic does not utilize copper wireline infrastructure

                    A wireless internet service provider (WISP) is an internet service provider (ISP) 
                    that allows subscribers to connect to the internet at designated hot spots or access 
                    points using a wireless connection such as Wi-Fi.
                    This type of ISP offers broadband service and allows subscriber computers and other devices, 
                    called stations, to access the internet and the web from anywhere within the service's coverage area. 
                    This is usually a region with a radius of several kilometers.One of the most influential communication 
                    models, peer-to-peer communication, or P2P communication, refers to a decentralized approach of networking 
                    where two end devices (peers) interact directly with each other. Both peers exchange information with each 
                    other without the need for any intermediate servers.
                    Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks 
                    or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the network. This forms 
                    a peer-to-peer network of nodes.

                    For homes with no existing full fibre connection, the required engineer visit itself should not take 
                    more than a couple of hours. The main delay will be waiting for a free time slot for the work to be done. 
                    The whole process should take less than an hour for homes that already have a full-fibre connection.
                    If you have an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) like this on the outside of your location, your connection is 
                    fiber-optic. If you have a Network Interface Device (NID) box like one of these on the outside of your location, 
                    your connection is copper.
